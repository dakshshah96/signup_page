# AnalogSea Signup Page

A simple and cool looking signup page project for a fictional company, AnalogSea.

## Scenario

You're freelancing for a cloud computing startup called AnalogSea. The task is to code up the first version (aka, v1) of a simple account creation page. For v1, the client wants clean, SEO and accessibility friendly HTML. They're providing you with a design file and a list of requirements for the form, and by end of day, you need to deliver a live version of the page they can preview on GitHub pages.
